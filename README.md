# LLMs on Custom Data using Langchain and RAGs! ðŸ¤–

In this project, I've implemented LLMs on custom data, using the power of RAG and Langchain.

## Getting Started

Add you openai api ket in constants.py file
You need to add PDF files to docs folder, then execute the index.py to get those PDFs indexed in vector database.
You do not need to reupload data again and again, you can just add more data to docs and execute index.py to index more and more data.
Then you can execute the main.py and you are good to go.
